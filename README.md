# How to use this?
There are two folders in this repository<br>
One folder is for Client and the other is for Server.<br>
You can make one laptop as Server and place the Server folder in it. <br>
Consider any other laptop or PC as Client. Place the client folder in that PC/Laptop. You can also place the Client folder in the same laptop which you have opted as Server. <br>

# Necessary Changes in the files.
You have to change the Server IP in the server.py and client.py file. Remember the server IP should be same in both files.

# How to get Server IP?
1. Open command prompt (cmd)
2. type ipconfig
3. check for ipv4 address LAN
4. copy that address and place in both server.py and client.py file
